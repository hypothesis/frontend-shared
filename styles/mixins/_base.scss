 * Override CSS rules.

 * This mixin serves two purposes:
 * - Allows developers to be explicit that the contained CSS rule-set overrides
 *   styling imposed by another pattern
 * - Increases the specificity of the contained rule-set to aid in overriding
 *
 * Current implementation: Use the :not pseudo-class to increase specifity.
